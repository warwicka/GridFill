GridFill
========

my first little pygame thing

It's a basic slider game.
Scoring is currently based purely on how many squares are on screen when the spacebar is hit.
All squares are controlled by the arrow keys. 
When a square comes in contact with an edge or corner of the window, it splits into two or three blocks; when two
  squares meet at a single space, they are both eliminated.
  
Currently, the game spawns two random squares at the start and runs at a leisurely 5 FPS.
